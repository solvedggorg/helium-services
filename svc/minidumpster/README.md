# minidumpster

Crash reporting handler used by Helium for Crashpad minidump uploads, hosted on
https://crash.helium.computer. Reports are symbolicated with
[@getsentry/symbolicator].

### privacy policy

this service collects crash reports submitted by Helium. these reports contain
technical information about the crashed process and system, including the Helium
version, operating system, architecture, crash annotations and stack or memory
data captured by crashpad. because crash reports may contain fragments of
process memory, they may unintentionally contain personal or otherwise sensitive
data.

crash reports are used only to diagnose and group Helium crashes. raw reports
and derived report data are kept for 30 days by default, after which they are
automatically deleted. access to reports is restricted to active members of the
imputnet GitHub organization.

client IP addresses are used temporarily for rate limiting and are not stored by
this service. logs contain report identifiers and technical build or processing
information, but do not contain crash dumps or arbitrary crash annotations.

## setup

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# fill in all required fields (see inline comments for help)

mkdir -p data
docker compose up -d --build
```

the crash endpoint uses the first `X-Forwarded-For` address for rate limiting,
so the reverse proxy must overwrite that header.

## local development

```sh
deno task dev:seed
deno task dev:mock
```

the mock server intentionally does not run the processing worker, retention, or
artifact crawler. uploads appear as pending and remain available for UI work.
use `DEV_DATA_DIR=/some/path deno task dev:mock` to choose another data
directory, including a more durable location outside the checkout.

## usage

point `CrashReporterClient::GetUploadUrl()` to `https://$hostname/crash`

## uploading symbols

```sh
# zip up debug files
# - pdb + exe/dlls on windows
# - dSYMs on macOS
# - unstripped ELF binaries on linux
zip -r symbols.zip out/Release/*.pdb out/Release/mybrowser.exe ...

curl -sS -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SYMBOL_UPLOAD_TOKEN" \
  --data-binary @symbols.zip \
  "https://$hostname/api/symbols?product=mybrowser&version=138.0.1.0"
```
